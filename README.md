## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a programmer doing my best to explore as much coding as I can. There is always something to learn, new skills to obtain and new challenges to face.

  -Currently doing Boot.dev Backend Developer courses
  -Dipping into advanced Python projects
  -Tinkering with and exploring Typescript

My passion for coding originated way back when I became obsessed with the FORGE gamemode in the Halo videoogame series that allowed players to create there own maps and modes. Eventually this evolved into game development which drove me to pursue software development. During this time I have experimented with many languages including Python, C#, Java Javascript, CSS and Typescript but I have not chosen a favorite yet as I am still exploring others.

I am currently developing a vocabulary game designed for mobile primarly using Typescript and all the additonal features typescript offers is starting to make javascript harder to go back to. Currently there is only a guess the word 'hangman'style game but I plan to continue improving this game and adding more modes and features! Addionally in the python front I am working on a personal finance tracker to help me with budgeting and creating reports on my spending.

I'd love to join a passionate team where I can make an impact early and learn from my fellow members. If you are hiring, let's chat!
