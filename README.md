# Hello, World! 👋

I'm a curious developer on a mission to explore the vast universe of coding. Learning new skills and tackling fresh challenges keeps me energized as a programmer.

## My Journey 🚀

My coding adventure began in the gamemode of FORGE in the Xbox series Halo (Halo Reach specifically), where I discovered the profound joy of building custom maps and game modes. I dedicated myself to crafting competitive, meticulously balanced environments that challenged players while maintaining fair gameplay dynamics. My designs even earned recognition in several Forge map competitions, fueling my creative confidence.

This early spark evolved into a deeper fascination with game development, ultimately guiding me toward a broader path in software engineering. While I'm still growing and learning in this expansive field, that original passion for intuitive level design continues to burn brightly. I find myself naturally gravitating toward games with robust creation tools, where I can experiment with mechanics and spatial design concepts during my free time.

## Tech Stack 💻

I've explored multiple languages and frameworks including:
- Python for data analysis, automation, pygame and file management. (Probably the language I am most familiar with)
- TypeScript/JavaScript for web and mobile development. usually using React as the framework. (This is what I am using for my current project)
- C# for game development and other projects
- Java for backend solutions
- HTML/CSS for crafting user interfaces

I appreciate TypeScript's robust features (making vanilla JavaScript harder to return to!), I'm keeping an open mind as I continue exploring new technologies.

## Current Projects 🔥

🎮 WordUp - A mobile vocabulary game built with TypeScript, currently featuring a "hangman" style mode with more modes and features on the roadmap. it is designed for both IOS and Android

💰 Personal Finance Tracker - A Python application to help with budgeting and spending analysis. file importing, creating and analyzing are planned for the future

🏋️‍♂️ Building a Discord Bot - javascript bot to improve the quality of my discord servers.

## Let's Connect 🤝

I'm seeking opportunities to join a passionate team where I can make an early impact while growing alongside talented developers. If your team values curiosity and continuous learning, I'd love to chat!
