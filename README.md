## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a programmer doing my best to explore as much coding as I can. there is always something to learn, new skills to obtain and new challenges to face.

My passion for coding originated way back when I became obsessed with the FORGE gamemode in the Halo videoogame series that allowed players to create there own maps and modes. Eventually this spilled into game development which drove me to pursue software development. During this time I have exparimented with many languages including Python, C#, Java Javascript, CSS and Typescript but I have not chosen a favorite yet as i am still exploring others like Ruby, Rust and GO.

I am currently developing a mobile game primarly using Typescript and all the additonal features is starting to make javascript harder and harder to go back to.

I'd love to join a passionate team where I can make an impact early and learn from my fellow members. If you are hiring, let's chat!
