# Hello, World! 👋

I'm a curious developer on a mission to explore the vast universe of coding. Learning new skills and tackling fresh challenges keeps me energized as a programmer.

## My Journey 🚀

My coding adventure began with the FORGE gamemode in Halo, where I discovered the joy of creating custom maps and modes. I loved to create maps that were competitive and balanced. i even entered a Forge map contest or two. This creative spark evolved into an interest for game development, which ultimately led me to pursue software engineering as a career. I Still ahve alot to learn but my love for simple level creation still burns and I almost always tinker with games that have this feature.

## Tech Stack 💻

I've explored multiple languages and frameworks including:
- Python for data analysis, automation, pygame and file management. (Probably the language I am most familiar with)
- TypeScript/JavaScript for web and mobile development. usually using React as the framework. (This is what I am using for my current project)
- C# for game development and other projects
- Java for backend solutions
- HTML/CSS for crafting user interfaces

While I appreciate TypeScript's robust features (making vanilla JavaScript harder to return to!), I'm keeping an open mind as I continue exploring new technologies.

## Current Projects 🔥

🎮 **WordUp** - A mobile vocabulary game built with TypeScript, currently featuring a "hangman" style mode with more modes and features on the roadmap. it is designed for both IOS and Android

💰 **Personal Finance Tracker** - A Python application to help with budgeting and spending analysis. file importing, creating and analyzing are planned for the future

🏋️‍♂️ **Boot.dev Journey** - Working through the Boot.dev curriculum to strengthen my backend development skills and build production-ready applications with Go, Python, Java, Kubernetes and SQL.

## Let's Connect 🤝

I'm seeking opportunities to join a passionate team where I can make an early impact while growing alongside talented developers. If your team values curiosity and continuous learning, I'd love to chat!
